Figure 2. The Kernel Alphas
In the customer area of concern the team needs to understand the stakeholders and the opportunity to be addressed:
    
    Customer 영역에서 관심사는 팀이 이해당사자들을 
    이해하는 것이 필요로 하고 the opportunity에 관심을 기울이는 것이
    다루는 것이 필요로 한다.

* Stakeholders: The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system.

        이해당사자들: 소프트 시스템에 영향을 주거나 받는 사람, 그룹, 조직들
    
    The stakeholders provide the opportunity and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. The team members are also stakeholders. The stakeholders should be involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system is produced.

        이해당사자들은  소프트웨어 시스템을 위한 요구사항들의 원천과  기금과  
        the opportunity 를 공급한다. 
        팀원의 멤버들 또한 이해당사자이다. 이해당사자들은 팀을 지원하기 위한  
        소프트엔지니어링적인 (도처에)노력을 포함되어야 하며 ,
        (받아드릴수 있는)허용될 수 있는 소프트웨어 시스템이 공급 되도록 보장 해야 한다. 
    


* Opportunity: The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system.

        기회 : 적절하게  소프트웨어 시스템을  변화하고 개발하도록 만드는 상황들(변수들)

    The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the team’s shared understanding of the stakeholders’ needs, and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by providing justification for its development.

        The opportunity 는 최신의 또는 변화된 소프트웨어 시스템의 창조에 대한 이유를 명확하게 한다. 
        The opportunity는 이해당사자들의 요구들에 대한 팀에서 공유되는 이해 나타내고 ,
        새로운 소프트웨어 개발에 대한 정당성을 부여함으로써 시스템의 요구사항들을 형상화한다.
    
    In the solution area of concern the team needs to establish a shared understanding of the requirements, and implement, build, test, deploy and support a software system that fulfills them:
    
    
* Requirements: What the software system must do to address the opportunity and satisfy the 
stakeholders.
    
        요구사항들 : 소프트웨서 시스템에서 opportunity 를 구현해야하거나 이해당사자들을 
        만족시켜야할 것들을 말한다.

    It is important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the new system.
        
        소프트웨어 시스템에서 필요로 하는것을 발견하는 것은 중요하다. 
    
* Software System: A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the
execution of the software.

The primary product of any software engineering endeavor, a software system can be part of a larger software, hardware or business solution.
In the endeavor area of concern the team and its way-of-working have to be formed, and the work has to be done:

* Work: Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result.
In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to meet the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements, and addressing the opportunity, presented by the stakeholders. The work is guided by the practices that make up the team’s way-
of-working.

* Team: A group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery or support of a specific software system.
One or more teams plan and perform the work needed to create, update and/or change the software system.

* Way-of-Working: The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work.
The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it as necessary to their current context.
Each Alpha has a small set of states that are used when assessing progress and health. Associated with each state is a set of pre-defined checklists. The checklists are available in an abbreviated form, as shown on the cards, and in an expanded form, along with the abbreviated form as shown in tables later in this document.

It should be noted that the states are not just one-way linear progressions. Each time you reassess a state, if you do not meet all the checklist items, you can go back to a previous state. You can also iterate through the states multiple times depending on your choice of practices.

The Alphas should not be viewed as a physical partitioning of your endeavor or as just abstract work products. Rather they represent critical indicators of the things that are most important to monitor and progress. As an example, team members, while they are part of the Team Alpha, are also stakeholders, and therefore, they can also be part of the Stakeholders Alpha. In the following sections more detailed information about each of the seven alphas is provided including full state checklists and checklist abbreviations that can also be found on the alpha state cards. It is recommended that users not use the abbreviations until they have attained a solid understanding of the full checklists. To aid the use of the Essence framework some redundant checklist items have been suppressed in the abbreviated versions.

## 2.1 Stakeholders


Stakeholders: The people, groups, or organizations who affect or are affected by a software system.
The stakeholders provide the opportunity, and are the source of the requirements and funding for the software system. They are involved throughout the software engineering endeavor to support the team and ensure that an acceptable software system is produced.
    
    이해당사자들 : 소프트웨어 시스템에 영향을 받거나 혹은 주는 조직, 단체, 사람들을이다.
    이해당사자들은 기회를 공급하고 소프트웨어 시스템의 요구사항의 근원이며, 자금을 제공한다.

Stakeholders are critical to the success of the software system and the work done to produce it. Their input and feedback help shape the software engineering endeavor and the resulting software system.

    이해당사자들은 소프트웨서 시스템의 성공에서 중요하고 요구사항과 
    자금을 공급하여 작업을 완료한다.
    이해당사자들의 산출물과 피트백은 소트트웨어 엔지리어링 노력과 결과를 형성하는데 도움을 준다.

## 2.2 Opportunity
Opportunity: The set of circumstances that makes it appropriate to develop or change a software system. 

    시장 기회 : 적절하게  소프트웨어 시스템을  변화하고 개발하도록 만드는 상황들(변수들)
    
The opportunity articulates the reason for the creation of the new, or changed, software system. It represents the team’s shared understanding of the stakeholders’ needs, and helps shape the requirements for the new software system by providing justification for its development.
    
    기회는 새롭고 변화된 소프트웨어 시스템의 창조에 대한 이유를 설명해준다.
    기회는 이해당사자들의 욕구들에 대한 팀에 공유되는 이해로 나타내고,
    개발에 대한 정당성을 부여함으로써 새로운 소프트웨어시스템에 대한 요구사항을 
    형성하는데 도움을 준다 
    
It is the opportunity that unites the stakeholders and provides the motivation for producing a new or updated software system. 
    
    기회는 이해당사자들을 결속시키고 새롭고 변화된 소프트웨어 시스템을
    생산하는 동기를 제공하는 것이다.
    
It is by understanding the opportunity that you can identify the value and the desired outcome that the stakeholders hope to realize from the use of the software system, either alone or as part of a broader business or technical solution.

    기회는 당신은 가치와  
    이해당사자들이 소프트웨어 시스템의 사용 또는 넓은 상업적 
    또는 기술적인 솔루션으로부터 실현하려고 하는 바램과 가치들을 
    인식할 수 있는 것이 기회이다.

## 3.3	Requirements

Requirements: What the software system must do to address the opportunity and satisfy the stakeholders.

It is important to discover what is needed from the software system, share this understanding among the stakeholders and the team members, and use it to drive the development and testing of the new system.

The requirements are captured as a set of requirement items. The requirement items can be communicated and recorded in various forms and at various levels of detail.

It is important that the overall state of the requirements is understood as well as the state of the individual requirement items. Amongst other things this will help you tell when the system is finished, and judge whether or not an individual requirement item is in scope.

## 3.4	Software System
Software System: A system made up of software, hardware, and data that provides its primary value by the execution of the software.
A software system can be part of a larger software, hardware, business or social solution.
We use the term software system rather than software because software engineering results in more than just a piece of software. Whilst the value may well come from the software, a working software system depends on the combination of software, hardware and data to fulfill the requirements.


---

3.5	Team
Team: A group of people actively engaged in the development, maintenance, delivery or support of a specific software system.
One or more teams plan and perform the work needed to create, update and/or change the software system.

    팀 : 특정 소프트웨어의 대한 개발 , 유지  보수, 파견, 지원에 적극적으로 참여하는 그룹이다.
    하나 또는 그 이상의 팀들은 소프트웨어 시스템을 변화 또는 변경하고 만들어내는 것이 
    필요한 일을 계획하고 실행한다.
    
    
Software engineering is a team sport involving the collaborative application of many different competencies and skills. To achieve high performance, team members should reflect on how well they work together, and relate this to their potential and effectiveness in achieving their mission.

Normally a team consists of several people. Occasionally, however, work may be undertaken by an individual creating software purely for their own use and entertainment. A team requires at least two people, but most of the guidance provided by the Team Alpha can also be used to help single individuals when creating software.


---

## 3.6	Work
Work: Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result.
In the context of software engineering, work is everything that the team does to meet the goals of producing a software system matching the requirements and addressing the opportunity presented by the stakeholders. The work is guided by the practices that make up the team’s way-of-working.
The ability of team members to co-ordinate, organize, estimate, complete, and share their work has a profound effect on meeting their commitments and delivering value to their stakeholders. Team members need to understand how to carry out their work, and how to recognize when the work is going well.


---


## 3.7	Way of Working
Way-of-Working: The tailored set of practices and tools used by a team to guide and support their work. 

    작업 방식(개발 방식) : 잘 만들어진 절차와 도구는 팀의 작업을 돕거나 안내하기 위해서 사용된다.
    
The team evolves their way of working alongside their understanding of their mission and their working
environment. As their work proceeds they continually reflect on their way of working and adapt it to
their current context.

    팀의 임무에 대한 이해와 작업 환경과 같이 팀의 작업 방식 발전 시킨다. 팀의 작업을 진전시키기 위해서 , 팀은 지속적으로 팀의 작업방식을 고찰하고 , 현재 상황에 필요하도록 적용한다.
    
Software engineering is a team sport, one that requires the whole team to collaborate effectively
regardless of how the team is organized. They need to agree on a way of working that will support collaboration and guide them throughout the software engineering endeavor.
