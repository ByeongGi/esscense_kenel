# 1. Introduction
This Quick Reference Guides provides a brief introduction to the Essence Kernel. It is designed to support the use of the Essence Cards by software development teams and, in particular, the games that can be played with them. For more detailed information see the SEMAT User Guide available from www.semat.org and the full Essence Specification available from www.omg.org.

```이 퀵 가이드는 Essence Kernel에 대한 간단한 소개를 한다. 이 가이드는 소프트웨서 개발팀들에 의한 에센스 카드에 대한 사용을 지원하고 ,부분적으로 에센스커널을 실행할수 있는 게임으로도 사용할수 있도록 디자인했다.```




The use of the kernel and the cards has many benefits for individuals, teams and organizations. These include helping them to:
```커널의 사용 그리고 카드의 사용은 개개인과 , 팀과 조직들에게 많은 이익을 준다. 그 도움을 주는 사항은 다음을 포함한다.```

• Understand where they are 
• Understand what needs to be addressed 구현되어야 하는 것에 대한 이해 
• Track progress and health 과정과 상태의 추적
• Keep projects in balance and avoid catastrophic failures
프로젝트의 균형 유지와 재앙적인 실패들 피하기
• Form good sprint goals and other objectives

• Form teams
팀 형성하기 
• Define practice independent checkpoints, milestones and lifecycles. 
The Kernel is both simple and incredibly powerful as it 1) captures the key concepts involved in software engineering, 2) allows the progress and health of any software engineering endeavor to be tracked and assessed, and 3) provides the common ground for the definition of software engineering methods and practices.
1.1	What is Essence? Essence는 무엇인가?
Essence provides us with a thinking framework that allows teams to understand where they are and acts as a foundation for their way-of-working. At the heart of the Essence approach is the Essence Kernel – a simple state-driven model of software engineering. The Essence Kernel captures the small set of things that are universal to all software engineering endeavors; the things that a team always has to consider or work with when developing software.
Essence는 생각의 틀을 우리에게 제공한다 팀들이 이해할 수 있도록 
Essence Kernel 접근의 핵심은 Essence Kernel(소프트웨어 엔지리어링 단순 상태-지향) 이다. 
The kernel contains seven key elements - Requirements, Software System, Team, Work, Way of Working, Opportunity and Stakeholders. Through states defined on these elements, the kernel provides an intuitive tool for practitioners to reason about the progress and health of their endeavors in a practice- independent way. To distinguish them from the many work products used to describe them these elements are called Alphas. The Alpha view is complemented with two other views 1) a competency- based view of the skill sets the team needs to be able to do them with and 2) an activity focused view of the things that teams always have to do. By populating these views with their practices, teams can quickly assemble, analyze, and share their own way-of-working.
By focusing on the essential things inherent in all software development efforts the Essence Kernel provides a simple definition of the common ground shared by all software development teams regardless of the kind of software being developed, of how the team is organized, of what practices get selected, the size of the system being produced, and the complexity of the problem being addressed.
In summary, the Essence Kernel is a stripped-down, light-weight set of definitions that captures the essence of effective, scalable software engineering in a practice independent way. It gives us a new way to look at the domain of software engineering, a new way to understand the progress and health of our development efforts, and a new way to combine practices into an effective way-of-working. It provides a common reference model all teams can use as they continuously inspect, adapt, and improve their ways of working.
